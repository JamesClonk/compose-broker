**compose-broker** is a [Compose.io](https://www.compose.com/) [service broker](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/) for [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

It supports databases and services such as:
- [üêò PostgreSQL](https://www.compose.com/databases/postgresql)
- [üê¨ MySQL](https://www.compose.com/databases/mysql)
- [üëª RethinkDB](https://www.compose.com/databases/rethinkdb)
- [üêô ScyllaDB (Cassandra)](https://www.compose.com/databases/scylladb)
- [üï∑ Elasticsearch](https://www.compose.com/databases/elasticsearch)
- [üê¶ Redis](https://www.compose.com/databases/redis)
- [üêü etcd](https://www.compose.com/databases/etcd)
- [üêá RabbitMQ](https://www.compose.com/databases/rabbitmq)

## Usage

#### Deploy service broker to Cloud Foundry

1. create an [API Token](https://app.compose.io/oauth/api_tokens) on your Compose.io [account](https://app.compose.io/account)
2. pick a Cloud Foundry provider.
   I'd suggest the [Swisscom AppCloud](https://developer.swisscom.com/)
3. push the app, providing the API key and a username/password to secure the service broker with
4. register the service broker in your space (`--space-scoped`)
5. check `cf marketplace` to see your new available service plans

![create service broker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JamesClonk/compose-broker/recordings/setup-min.gif "create service broker")

#### Provision new databases

1. create a new service instance (`cf cs`)
2. bind the service instance to your app (`cf bs`), or create a service key (`cf csk`)
3. inspect the service binding/key, have a look at the credentials (`cf env`/`cf sk`)
4. use the given credentials to connect to your new database
5. enjoy!

## Configuration

All configuration of the service broker is done through environment variables (provided by `manifest.yml` during `cf push`) and the included `catalog.yml`.

### manifest.yml

Possible configuration values are:
```yaml
BROKER_LOG_LEVEL: info # optional, can be set to debug, info, warning, error or fatal, defaults to info
BROKER_LOG_TIMESTAMP: false # optional, add timestamp to logging messages (not needed when deployed on Cloud Foundry), defaults to false
BROKER_SKIP_SSL_VALIDATION: false, # optional, disables SSL certificate verification for API calls, defaults to false
BROKER_AUTH_USERNAME: broker-username # required, HTTP basic auth username to secure service broker with
BROKER_AUTH_PASSWORD: broker-password # required, HTTP basic auth password to secure service broker with
BROKER_CATALOG_FILENAME: catalog.yml # optional, filename containing all catalog information, defaults to catalog.yml
COMPOSE_API_URL: https://api.compose.io/2016-07/ # optional, Base URL of Compose.io API, defaults to https://api.compose.io/2016-07
COMPOSE_API_TOKEN: e7fb89a0-26f8-4ee5-890e-3c68079b15ea # required, Compose.io API Token
COMPOSE_API_DEFAULT_DATACENTER: aws:eu-central-1 # optional, defaults to aws:eu-central-1
COMPOSE_API_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_ID: 586eab527c65836dde5533e8 # optional, service broker will try to read it from Compose.io API
```

### Default Datacenter

By default the service broker will provision new database deployments in the configured datacenter `COMPOSE_API_DEFAULT_DATACENTER` (see `manifest.yml`) or if none configured at all it will use `aws:eu-central-1` as default value.
When issuing service provisioning requests to the service broker it is also possible to provide the datacenter as an additional parameter.
###### Example:
```
$ cf create-service etcd default my-etcd -c '{"datacenter": "gce:europe-west1"}'
```
